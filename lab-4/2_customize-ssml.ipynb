    "## Customizing Riva TTS audio output with SSML\n",
    "\n",
    "Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) specification is a markup for directing the performance of the virtual speaker. Riva supports portions of SSML, allowing you to adjust pitch, rate, and pronunciation of the generated audio.\n",
    "SSML support is available only for the FastPitch model at this time. The FastPitch model must be exported using NeMo>=1.5.1 and the nemo2riva>=1.8.0 tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "All SSML inputs must be a valid XML document and use the <speak> root tag. All non-valid XML and all valid XML with a different root tag are treated as raw input text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Riva TTS supports the following SSML tags:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The ``prosody`` tag, which supports attributes ``rate``, ``pitch``, and ``volume``, through which we can control the rate, pitch, and volume of the generated audio.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The ``phoneme`` tag, which allows us to control the pronunciation of the generated audio.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- The ``sub`` tag, which allows us to replace the pronounciation of the specified word or phrase with a different word or phrase.\n",

    "#### Pitch Attribute\n",
    "Riva supports an additive relative change to the pitch. The `pitch` attribute has a range of [-3, 3]. Values outside this range result in an error being logged and no audio returned. This value returns a pitch shift of the attribute value multiplied with the speaker’s pitch standard deviation when the FastPitch model is trained. For the pretrained checkpoint that was trained on LJSpeech, the standard deviation was 52.185. For example, a pitch shift of 1.25 results in a change of 1.25*52.185=~65.23Hz pitch shift up. \n",
    "Riva also supports the prosody tags as per the SSML specs. Prosody tags `x-low`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `x-high`, and `default` are supported.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `pitch` attribute is expressed in the following formats:\n",
    "- `pitch=\"1\"`\n",
    "- `pitch=\"+1.8\"`\n",
    "- `pitch=\"-0.65\"`\n",
    "- `pitch=\"high\"`\n",
    "- `pitch=\"default\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "For the pretrained Female-1 checkpoint, the standard deviation is 53.33 Hz.\n",
    "For the pretrained Male-1 checkpoint, the standard deviation is 47.15 Hz.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `pitch` attribute does not support `Hz`, `st`, and `%` changes. Support is planned for a future Riva release.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Rate Attribute\n",
    "Riva supports a percentage relative change to the rate. The `rate` attribute has a range of [25%, 250%]. Values outside this range result in an error being logged and no audio returned. \n",
    "Riva also supports the prosody tags as per the SSML specs. Prosody tags `x-low`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `x-high`, and `default` are supported.\n",

    "- `rate=\"default\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Volume Attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "Riva supports the volume attribute as described in the SSML specs. The volume attribute supports a range of [-13, 8]dB. Values outside this range result in an error being logged and no audio returned. Tags `silent`, `x-soft`, `soft`, `medium`, `loud`, `x-loud`, and `default` are supported.\n",
